## Mod Description

This Forge Mod adds a simple coin system. Perfect for servers.

The system works in a way that there are a few different coin item (1 coin, 5 coins, 20 coins, 50 coins, 100 coins, 500 coins) as well as a wallet item that can be used to store all coins.

Interacting with the wallet opens a gui where coins or other wallets can be transferred into the opened wallet. In the gui every kind of coin can be extracted as well as a set coin value. And if that is too much you can even take a coin pile with a set amount of coins to transfer to another player or wallet.
